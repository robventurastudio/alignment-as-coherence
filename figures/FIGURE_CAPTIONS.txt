FIGURE 1 — Reaction–Diffusion Baseline
Demonstrates fundamental coherence propagation in a homogeneous field. Front velocity c ≈ 2√(Dλ).

FIGURE 2 — Extended Dynamics Under Attack
Shows heterogeneous diffusion and adversarial pressure; system maintains coherence through adaptive feedback.

FIGURE 3 — Alignment Faking Detector
Visualizes hidden preference islands; regions where surface alignment diverges from deep values.

FIGURE 4 — Phase Transition and Critical Strength
Displays continuous phase transition in alignment dynamics, critical strength ≈ 1.81 marking faking→genuine crossover.
