# 🧬 Alignment as Coherence — v1.0 Release Notes  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Author:** Robert C. Ventura  
**Affiliation:** Rob Ventura Fine Art LLC

### 🪶 Summary

**Alignment as Coherence v1.0** marks the first complete release of a fully integrated research toolkit for exploring AI alignment as a physical system of coherence propagation.

This version introduces a full suite of self-contained, reproducible models and visualizations bridging **nonlinear dynamics**, **AI safety**, and **interpretability**.  
It demonstrates how deceptive alignment and value internalization can be modeled as **continuous field phenomena**, revealing phase transitions between faking and genuine alignment.

### 🧠 Core Contributions

1. **Coherence Field Model**  
   Implements a Fisher–KPP reaction–diffusion system to model the spread of alignment through a belief field.  
   Derives the universal speed of coherence:  
   \[ c = 2\sqrt{D\lambda} \]

2. **Extended Adversarial Dynamics**  
   Adds heterogeneous diffusion, adaptive adversarial pressure, and global feedback loops — showing how coherence stabilizes under attack.

3. **Alignment Faking Detection**  
   Introduces deep vs surface value fields and a detection method for hidden preference islands.  
   Identifies spatially localized misalignment despite high surface accuracy.

4. **Phase Transition Analysis**  
   Discovers a *critical training strength* (≈1.81 ± 0.1) separating superficial compliance from genuine value internalization.  
   Uses Lyapunov and FFT analysis to quantify alignment stability and structure.

5. **Visual Diagnostics Suite**  
   Includes 4 publication-quality figures and an interpretable phase diagram summarizing all core findings.

### ⚗️ Research Implications

- Provides a **physics-grounded framework** for reasoning about alignment faking and deceptive dynamics.  
- Enables **early detection** of alignment breakdown during training, not just post-hoc evaluation.  
- Suggests new RLHF optimization strategies that target *critical coherence thresholds* rather than static reward objectives.  
- Offers a path to connect theoretical coherence models with Anthropic’s SAE interpretability pipeline.

### 🧭 Next Directions

1. **Empirical Validation**
   - Map coherence fields to SAE latent feature activations.  
   - Measure real alignment phase transitions in Anthropic-scale RLHF data.  

2. **Coherence-Aware RLHF**
   - Adapt training intensity dynamically using phase boundary predictions.  
   - Test whether “coherence-aware” optimization reduces deceptive alignment rates.  

3. **Theoretical Expansion**
   - Extend from 1D → multi-domain coherence topologies.  
   - Explore coupling between alignment and interpretability gradients.

### 🪐 Statement from the Author

> “Alignment is not a fixed moral parameter; it’s a living field — a gradient between truth and noise.  
>  What we call ‘alignment’ is coherence in disguise.”
